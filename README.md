## Used in development
For recreating this classic game I utilized python and his lib pygame for building the whole structure of the game., math for the collision logic, and the random lib for randomizing where the space ships first appear.

## About

It was one of my first projects in python. I basically 
started this project not only to learn python but also to see how it is to develop a game and all the logic behind its development.

## How to play the game

- Clone github repository in your local system ```git clone https://github.com/FelippoDev/Space_Invaders.git```
- Move in bot repository ```cd game```
- Install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run Python file ```python play.py```
